1. Copy the configuration template:
   ```bash
   cp config_template.yaml config.yaml
   ```

2. Edit `config.yaml` and update:
   - `file_organization.drive_for_mac_root`: Your Google Drive sync path (e.g., `/Users/yourname/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-your.email@gmail.com/My Drive`)
   - `user` section: Your personal information

### 5. Prompts Configuration

1. Copy the prompts template:

### 6. Google Drive Folder Structure and Templates

#### A. Create Folder Structure
Create this folder structure in your Google Drive:

```
resume-automation-system/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resumes/              # Your baseline resume content files
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Engineering Manager.docx
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Senior Software Engineer.docx
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data Engineering Manager.docx
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Senior Engineering Manager.docx
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Engineering Manager Template.docx     # Output formatting templates
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cover Letter Template.docx
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Interview Prep Notes Template.docx
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ready-for-review/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (generated resumes will appear here)
```

#### B. Copy Templates from Repository
**Important:** Copy all template files from this repository's `templates/` folder to your Google Drive `resume-automation-system/templates/` folder. These include:
- All `.docx` template files for output formatting
- Sample baseline resume files

#### C. Create Your Baseline Resume Files
In the `templates/resumes/` folder, create your baseline resume files. **The filenames must exactly match the template names in your `config.yaml`:**

- If `config.yaml` lists `engineering_manager: "Engineering Manager"`, create `Engineering Manager.docx`
- If `config.yaml` lists `senior_software_engineer: "Senior Software Engineer"`, create `Senior Software Engineer.docx`
- And so on...

These files contain your complete resume content that will be optimized for each specific job application.

## Usage

### Daily Workflow - How to Apply for Jobs

Here's the typical workflow for applying to jobs using this system:

#### 1. Generate Resume Package
1. **Find a job** you want to apply for
2. **Copy the job posting URL** and paste it into the "Job Description URL" field
3. **Review auto-detected information**:
   - Company name (auto-scraped from URL)
   - Role/position title (auto-detected from job description)
   - Salary range (if available)
   - Best-fit resume template (auto-selected based on job requirements)
4. **Verify and correct** any auto-detected fields if needed
5. **Add your motivation notes** explaining why you're interested in this role
6. **Click "Generate Resume Package"**

The system will create:
- Tailored resume optimized for this specific job
- Custom cover letter
- Interview preparation notes

#### 2. Review and Download from Google Drive
1. **Navigate to your Google Drive** ‚Üí `resume-automation-system/ready-for-review/[Company] - [Position]/`
2. **Review the generated resume**:
   - Ideally, make no changes or only trivial adjustments
   - The content should be pre-optimized for the job
3. **Review the generated cover letter**:
   - Again, ideally minimal to no changes needed
   - Should be tailored to the company and role
4. **Download both files**:
   - Save as DOCX for editing capability
   - Save as PDF for final submission

#### 3. Apply for the Job
1. **Submit your application** through the company's normal process
2. **Upload the generated resume** (PDF recommended)
3. **Upload the generated cover letter** (PDF recommended)
4. **Use the interview prep notes** to prepare for potential interviews

#### 4. Track Your Application
1. **Open the resume tracker** (Excel file in your Google Drive)
2. **Find your job entry** - it should be pre-populated with:
   - Company name
   - Role/position title
   - Job posting URL
   - Salary range (if detected)
3. **Update the "Applied" column** with today's date
4. **Track follow-ups** and interview progress as they occur

This workflow is designed to take a job application from discovery to submission in under 10 minutes, with most of that time spent on review rather than content creation.

### Start the Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or alternatively:
uv run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

This will start the FastAPI server with hot-reload enabled on http://localhost:8000

### Web Interface

Open http://localhost:8000/static/index.html in your browser to access the web interface.

### Alternative Start Commands

```bash
# Using npm (recommended)
npm run dev

# Using uv directly
uv run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# For production
uv run uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Important Limitations and Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Version 1 Limitations - Please Read:**

### Template Limitations
- **Single output format**: There is only one type of output resume template. If you don't like the format, you'll need to create your own Jinja2 template or you may find this application unusable.
- **Jinja2 knowledge helpful**: Users familiar with Jinja templating will find customization straightforward. Others may find template modification to be an insurmountable barrier.

### Baseline Resume Recommendations
- **Use baseline files**: While you technically don't need baseline resume files (you could paste content each time), this would dramatically slow you down and counteract one of the main goals of this application.
- **Recommended**: Create and maintain your baseline resume files as described in the setup.

### Configuration Customization
- **4-job limit**: The output resume is configured to contain only 4 jobs by default. Modify `config.yaml` to increase or decrease this number.
- **Customize everything**: Modify `config.yaml` to adjust:
  - Number of achievements per job
  - Prompt optimization for your specific situation
  - Personal information and company details
  - Template mappings and file names

## Configuration Options

### Resume Templates

Available templates in `config.yaml`:
- `engineering_manager`: Engineering Manager
- `senior_engineering_manager`: Senior Engineering Manager  
- `data_engineering_manager`: Data Engineering Manager
- `senior_software_engineer`: Senior Software Engineer
- `software_engineer`: Software Engineer
- `lead_data_engineer`: Lead Data Engineer
- `data_engineer`: Data Engineer

**Important:** Your baseline resume files in `templates/resumes/` must be named exactly as shown in the right column above. For example:
- `Engineering Manager.docx` (matches the `engineering_manager` template)
- `Senior Software Engineer.docx` (matches the `senior_software_engineer` template)

### Template Format

Your .docx templates should use Jinja2 template tags that can be replaced:

```
{{name}}
{{email}}
{{phone}}
{{linkedin}}
{{jobtitle}}
{{company}}
{{content}}
{{key_achievements_list}}
{{skill_categories}}
```

The system uses DocxTpl to replace these template tags with actual values during processing.

### Prompt Configuration

The system uses 3 prompts:
1. **Prompt 1**: Resume optimization
2. **Prompt 2**: Cover letter generation
3. **Prompt 3**: Interview prep notes

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` or `service_account.json` files
- Never commit `config.yaml` or `prompts.yaml` files
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Regularly rotate API keys and service account credentials
- Keep `service_account.json` secure and never commit to version control
- Service account has full access to shared folders only
- Consider using folder-level permissions rather than drive-wide access
- Regularly rotate service account keys if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No resume content loaded"**: Check that baseline resume files exist in `templates/resumes/`
2. **Google Drive authentication errors**: Verify service account permissions
3. **API rate limits**: Adjust `system.rate_limit_delay` in config.yaml
4. **Template parsing errors**: Ensure template files have correct format
5. **"Service account file not found"**: Ensure `service_account.json` is in the project root and check file permissions
6. **"Failed to connect to Google Drive"**: Verify APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console, check service account has access to folders, and ensure folder IDs are correct
7. **"Template not found"**: Verify template names in config.yaml match actual template files, check templates folder ID is correct
8. **"Permission denied"**: Share folders with service account email and give Editor permissions (not just Viewer)

### Debugging

Enable debug mode by setting environment variable:
```bash
export DEBUG=true
```

#### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test the resume generation endpoint
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/generate-resume" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"job_description": "test job", "motivation_notes": "test motivation", "resume_template": "engineering_manager", "company_name": "TestCorp", "position_title": "Test Role"}'
```

#### File Organization

Files are created in your Google Drive sync folder and organized as:
```
[Your Google Drive]/resume-automation-system/ready-for-review/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Company Name] - [Position Title]/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Resume - [Company] - [Position].docx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cover Letter - [Company] - [Position].docx
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Interview Prep Notes - [Company].docx
```
